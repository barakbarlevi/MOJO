MOJO - a ballistic trajectory analyzer
 
Purpose: Analyze live detection data of a single ballistic target, comparing it
to expected behavior from 6-DOF simulation outputs.
 
Description: The program receives detections live over the network. Detection 
data may contain any information that a generic sensor could be able to 
measure, such as estimated position, velocity etc. Starting at a pre-
determined point along the trajectory, the program will start executing a
series of 6-DOF simulation runs for an array of potential airframe models,
with the initial conditions being passed to it at the moment, from the tracked
data. The 6-DOF is a separate project. The simulation's results for all
airframe models will be stored. The program will continue to receive the live
ballistic target data until it hits the ground, and will be able generate
simulation outputs during the entire flight time. As soon as the first set of
simulation output is ready, the program will run a backgroud process to compare
target detections and simulation output against each other. This background
process can implement any logic coded into it, its purpose to send a
notification when some programmer-defined conditions have been met.

Input: The program isn't provided input parameters. It listens on a socket, and
handles data arriving on it.

Output: The program doesn't return a value other than '0' for success. If 
specified conditions relating the target track data and the simulation output
are met, a notification is sent.
   
Notes: 
1. As target detections are simulation output themselves, the point at
which calculations on the live 6-DOF executions start can be the detected
target in its starting conditions. This doesn't represnt a real life case for
ballisitic targets, since first detection is expected to occur after the object
has gained height. Parameter 'detectionHeight' of type double is set for this
reason.
2. In this program's context, the term 'Prediction' is referring to any type
of simulation's output, that describes the progression of a modeled airframe
motion through the air for the momentary initial conditions. The term
'Supplier' refers to the simulation's itself. In this program, the sole
supplier of predictions is the CADAC++ simulation, be anyone can add other
simulations as source of information, with adjusting to meet their required
metadata structure.
3. An effort was made to work according to coding conventions given in
https://geosoft.no/development/cppstyle.html.
